GPIO assisted NAND flash

The GPIO assisted NAND flash uses a memory mapped interface to
read/write the NAND commands and data and GPIO pins for the control
signals.

Required properties:
- compatible : "gpio-control-nand-shared"
- gpios : Specifies the shared GPIO pins to control the NAND devices.
  The order of GPIO references is:  ALE, CLE, RDY and an optional nWP.
- ranges: allows valid 1:1 translation between child's address space and
          parent's address space

Optional properties:
- bank-width : Width (in bytes) of the device.  If not present, the width
  defaults to 1 byte.
- chip-delay : chip dependent delay for transferring data from array to
  read registers (tR).  If not present then a default of 20us is used.
- xsc,concat : Boolean value (1 or 0) to use mtdconcat to create 1 mtd
  device containing all NAND chips.

The device tree must have at least one sub-node with the name nandflash.
It defines a NAND chip, with the address space to access it and the optional
nCE (Chip Enable) GPIO pin.

Required properties:
- reg : should specify localbus chip select and size used for the chip.  The
  resource describes the data bus connected to the NAND flash and all accesses
  are made in native endianness.
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.


The nandflash sub-nodes may optionally contain sub-nodes
describing partitions of the address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

The gpio-control-nand-shared node may also contain a "partitions" or multiple
partitions sub-nodes to be used with mtdconcat if xsc,concat is set to 1.

Examples:

gpio-nand@1,0 {
	compatible = "gpio-control-nand-shared";
	ranges;                 /* 1:1 translation */
	gpios = <&banka 1 0>,	/* RDY */
		<&banka 3 0>, 	/* ALE */
		<&banka 4 0>, 	/* CLE */
		<0>;		/* nWP */

	nandflash@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x80090000 0x10000>;
		gpios = <0>;    /* nCE */

		partition@0 {
			label = "backup-nand0";
			reg = <0x00000000 0x40000000>;
		};
	};

	nandflash@1 {
	...
	};

	partition@0 {
	...
	};
};
